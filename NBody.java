/** Your goal for this project is to write a program
 * simulating the motion of N objects in a plane,
 * accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object
 * as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.
 *
 * NBody is a class that will actually run your simulation.
 * This class will have NO constructor.
 * The goal of this class is to simulate a universe
 * specified in one of the data files.
 *
 * The input format is a text file that contains the information
 * for a particular universe (in SI units).
 * The first value is an integer N which represents the number of planets.
 * The second value is a real number R which represents the radius of
 * the universe, used to determine the scaling of the drawing window.
 * Finally, there are N rows, and each row contains 6 values.
 * The first two values are the x- and y-coordinates of the initial position;
 * the next pair of values are the x- and y-components of the initial velocity;
 * the fifth value is the mass;
 * the last value is a String that is the name of an image file used to display the planets.
 * Image files can be found in the images directory.
 * The file above contains data for our own solar system (up to Mars).
