/** Your goal for this project is to write a program
 * simulating the motion of N objects in a plane,
 * accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object
 * as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.
 *
 * NBody is a class that will actually run your simulation.
 * This class will have NO constructor.
 * The goal of this class is to simulate a universe
 * specified in one of the data files.
