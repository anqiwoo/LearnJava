/*
 * 1. All code in Java must be part of a class.
 * 2. Classes ara defined by public class CLASSNAME.
 * 3. We delimit the beginning and end of segments of code using { and }.
 * Curly braces are very important in Java!
 * Unlike Python, statements are grouped by braces, and NOT by indentation.
 * 4. All statements in Java must end in a semi-colon.
 * 5. For code to run, we need public static void main(String[] args){}.
